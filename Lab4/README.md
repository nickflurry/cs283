Run make to create both programs. Once they are complied you can run the programs through the terminal. 

./client google.com 80 index.html 
	to run the client and get back a page. 

./server 80
	to run server binding to port 80
	to access server "telenet localhost 80"
	and then you can run your get lines. 


Error checking is light in these programs since there are countless cases and I only have so much time in the day.
